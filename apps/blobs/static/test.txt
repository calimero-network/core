Calimero Blob API Example

This is a sample text file for testing the blob storage functionality.

Features demonstrated:
- File upload with blob announcement
- Metadata storage in contract
- Base58 blob ID encoding
- Multi-node blob discovery
- File retrieval by blob ID

The blob API enables decentralized file sharing across the Calimero network.
Each file is content-addressed and announced to peers for distributed access.

For more information, see the README.md file.
