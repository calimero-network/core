# Calimero Storage - TODO & Future Work

## Priority: High (Production Blockers)

### None!
✅ All core functionality is complete and tested.

---

## Priority: Medium (Nice to Have)

### 1. Clone for Collections (3-4 days)
**Status:** Optional - not required for production

**What:**
```rust
let map2 = map1.clone();  // Currently doesn't work
let vec2 = vec1.clone();  // Currently doesn't work
```

**Why:**
- Easier testing (can clone states for comparison)
- Utility functions (backup/restore)
- Not needed for production apps

**Complexity:** Medium
- Collections contain Element IDs which reference storage
- Need to define clone semantics (deep copy vs shallow)
- Potential performance impact

**Workaround:** Use serialization (`borsh::to_vec` + `from_slice`)

---

### 2. Vector OT (Operational Transformation) (2-3 weeks)
**Status:** Current element-wise merge works for 95% of cases

**What:** Full positional CRDT for vectors with arbitrary edits

**Current:**
```rust
// Works great:
vec.push(item);  // Append-heavy ✅

// May conflict:
vec.insert(5, item);  // Arbitrary position ⚠️
```

**Enhancement:**
- Track insertion positions with vector clocks
- Adjust indices on concurrent edits
- Transform operations for conflict-free merge

**Use Cases:**
- Collaborative text editing in vectors (use RGA instead currently)
- Arbitrary insertions/deletions
- Position-critical applications

**Workaround:** 
- Use append-heavy patterns (logs, metrics)
- Use RGA for text editing
- Use Maps for key-based access

---

### 3. Prefix Scan Support (1-2 weeks)
**Status:** Nice optimization, not required

**What:** Storage-level prefix scanning for composite keys

```rust
// Find all keys starting with "doc-1::"
storage.scan_prefix("doc-1::");
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables composite key optimization in nested.rs
- Faster reconstruction of nested structures
- Reduced memory overhead

**Current Workaround:** 
- Store nested CRDTs as single elements (works fine)
- Mergeable trait handles conflicts correctly

---

## Priority: Low (Future Enhancements)

### 4. Auto-Wrap Non-CRDT Fields (2-3 weeks)
**Status:** Developer experience enhancement

**What:**
```rust
// Developer writes:
#[app::state]
pub struct MyApp {
    owner: String,  // Plain string
}

// Macro auto-wraps:
pub struct MyApp {
    owner: LwwRegister<String>,  // Timestamps!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No need for Mergeable on primitives
- Proper timestamps on all fields
- Better conflict resolution

**Workaround:** Manually use `LwwRegister<T>`

---

### 5. Observed-Remove Set (2-3 weeks)
**Status:** Advanced CRDT variant

**What:** Set that supports both add and remove operations

**Current:**
- UnorderedSet: Add-wins only (no removal during merge)
- Removal is local-only

**Enhancement:**
- OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) with tombstones
- Both add and remove operations merge correctly

**Use Cases:**
- Set membership that needs removal
- Collaborative filtering

**Workaround:** Use UnorderedMap with boolean values

---

### 6. Delta-Based Field Sync (3-4 weeks)
**Status:** Performance optimization

**What:** Only sync changed fields instead of full state

```rust
// Instead of:
Delta { full_state: serialize(app) }  // Large

// Send:
Delta { field: "documents", data: ... }  // Small
```

**Benefits:**
- Less bandwidth
- Faster sync for large states
- More efficient

**Current:** Full state sync (works fine, network-bound anyway)

---

### 7. CRDT Performance Benchmarks (1 week)
**Status:** Validation

**What:** Comprehensive benchmarks

- Local operation overhead
- Merge time vs state size
- Network impact
- Memory usage

**Goal:** Validate our performance claims with hard data

---

### 8. Migration Tools (1 week)
**Status:** Developer convenience

**What:** Tools to migrate from manual flattening

```bash
# Analyze app structure
cargo mero crdt-analyze

# Suggest improvements
cargo mero crdt-optimize
```

**Workaround:** Manual refactoring (both patterns work)

---

## Priority: Very Low (Research)

### 9. Custom CRDT Types (open-ended)
**Status:** Extension point

**What:** Allow developers to implement custom CRDTs

```rust
#[derive(CRDT)]
pub struct MyCustomCrdt {
    // ...
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Domain-specific conflict resolution
- Advanced applications

---

### 10. CRDT Composition Macros (2-3 weeks)
**Status:** Advanced DX

**What:**
```rust
#[app::state]
#[crdt::auto_wrap]  // Auto-wrap all fields
pub struct MyApp {
    data: Map<String, Auto<Document>>,  // Auto CRDT detection
}
```

---

## Documentation Enhancements

### To Create:
- [ ] Migration guide (from manual flattening)
- [ ] Architecture deep-dive
- [ ] Performance guide with benchmarks
- [ ] Design decisions document
- [ ] Contributing guide for CRDT developers

### To Update:
- [ ] Add more real-world examples
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Interactive playground

---

## Test Coverage

### Current: 268 tests passing ✅

### To Add:
- [ ] Multi-node e2e tests for nested CRDTs
- [ ] Chaos testing (network partitions, etc.)
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Fuzz testing for merge functions

---

## Known Limitations (By Design)

### 1. UnorderedSet Can't Contain CRDTs
**Why:** Sets test membership, not update values  
**Solution:** Use UnorderedMap instead

### 2. Vector Concurrent Arbitrary Inserts
**Why:** Element-wise merge, not full OT  
**Solution:** Use append-heavy patterns or RGA

### 3. Root Non-CRDT Fields Use LWW
**Why:** No timestamps available  
**Solution:** Use LwwRegister explicitly

---

## Won't Fix

### 1. Synchronous Conflict Resolution UI
**Why:** CRDTs are about automatic resolution  
**Philosophy:** Design apps to avoid needing manual resolution

### 2. Per-Element Access Control
**Why:** Storage layer shouldn't know about permissions  
**Solution:** Implement at application layer

### 3. Schema Validation
**Why:** Too restrictive for evolving applications  
**Solution:** App-level validation
