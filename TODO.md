1. Code Duplication Cleanup
Issue: Multiple duplicate methods with nearly identical logic
Files: lib.rs - methods like test_add_channel_step_by_step and test_add_channel_step_by_step_string
Impact: Maintenance burden, potential for bugs when updating logic
2. Unused/Test-Only Code Removal
Issue: Several methods appear to be test-only and not needed in production
Methods to evaluate:
test_basic() - seems redundant with hello()
test_simple() - appears to be a simplified test version
test_add_channel_step_by_step() - duplicate of string version
test_add_channel_step_by_step_string() - test-only method
3. Method Consolidation
Issue: Multiple ways to add channels with overlapping functionality
Current methods:
add_channel() - core implementation
add_channel_string() - string-based wrapper
test_add_channel_step_by_step*() - test versions
Suggestion: Keep core add_channel() and add_channel_string() for API compatibility
4. Logging Cleanup
Issue: Extensive debug logging that may not be needed in production
Current: Many üîç debug logs throughout the code
Suggestion: Reduce to essential logging or make configurable
5. Error Handling Standardization
Issue: Some methods return app::Result<()> while others return app::Result<String>
Suggestion: Standardize return types for consistency
6. Documentation Updates
Issue: Code comments and documentation may be outdated
Suggestion: Update comments to reflect the new data structure
7. Test Method Organization
Issue: Test methods mixed with production methods
Suggestion: Consider moving test methods to a separate module or marking them clearly
