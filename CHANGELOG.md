# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Automatic nested CRDT support** - Applications can now use natural nested structures without state divergence
  - `LwwRegister<T>` - Last-Write-Wins register for any value with timestamp-based conflict resolution
  - `Mergeable` trait - Universal merge interface for all CRDT types
  - Automatic merge code generation via `#[app::state]` macro

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-05

Rust SDK:

  however).
- env::context_id() for fetching the context ID.
- calimero_storage::collections::{Unordered{Map,Set},Vector} for conflict-free
  operations
- Self::external() for external (blockchain) operations

Node:

- Removed the coordinator
- All messages sent between peers are now end-to-end encrypted
- Peers can share the application blob between one another, in case one of them
  doesn't have it installed
- The node has been split up into 2 binaries
  - merod retains node-specific commands, init, run, config
  - meroctl hosts client commands like context create, etc..
- merod config now has a generic & more flexible interface
- query & mutate in the API have now been merged into just execute
- interactive CLI now uses clap, making it more robust (merod)
- Added --output-format json for machine-readable output (meroctl)

Integrations:

- NEAR: expanded implementation to include a deployment of a proxy contract for
  every created context, which facilitates context representation on the network
- Starknet: reached feature parity with the NEAR implementation, allowing
  contexts to be created in association with the Starknet protocol.
