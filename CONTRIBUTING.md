Thank you for dedicating your time to contribute to our project.

This guide outlines the contribution workflow to make the process smooth and
effective for everyone.

Start by reading the [README][] to understand the project better.

## Project Status

This project is actively being developed.

You can check out the open [Issues][], monitor the development progress, and
contribute.

## Getting Started

There are several ways you can contribute:

- Solve open [Issues][]
- Report bugs or suggest features
- Enhance the documentation

Contributions are managed via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are some
general guidelines:

- Read our [Rust style guide][STYLE] to ensure compatibility with the rest of
  our codebase!

- Before creating a new Issue or PR, search for [existing ones][Issues].

- Contributions should focus on either functionality or style in the PR, not
  both.

- If you encounter an error, provide context. Explain what you are trying to do
  and how to reproduce the error.

- Follow the repositoryâ€™s formatting guidelines.

- Update the [README][] file if your changes affect it.

## Issues

Use [Issues][] to report problems, request features, or discuss changes before
creating a PR.

### Solving an Issue

Browse [existing issues][Issues] to find one that interests you.

## Contribution Guidelines for Working on Issues

If someone is already working on an issue, they will either be officially
assigned to it or have left a comment indicating they are working on it. If you
would like to work on an issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Comment on the Issue**: Leave a comment on the issue expressing your
   intention to work on it. For example, "I would like to work on this issue."

2. **Wait for Confirmation**: A project maintainer will confirm your assignment
   by officially assigning the issue to you or by acknowledging your comment.

3. **Start Working**: Once you have received confirmation, you can start working
   on the issue.

4. **Open a Pull Request**: When your work is ready, open a pull request (PR)
   with your solution. Make sure to mention in the PR that you are working on
   the issue by referencing the issue number in the PR description (e.g., "This
   PR addresses issue #123").

By following this process, we can avoid duplication of efforts and ensure clear
communication among all contributors.

## Creating a New Issue

If no related issue exists, you can create a new one.

Here are some tips:

- Provide detailed context to make it clear for others.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue or the rationale for a new feature.
- Attach screenshots, videos, etc., if applicable.

## Pull Requests

### Pull Request Workflow

We use the ["fork-and-pull"][GitPR] Git workflow:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the project.

3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.

4. Commit your changes to this new branch.

5. Push your changes to your fork.

6. Create a pull request from your fork to our repository. Use the `master`
   branch as the base branch.

7. Tag a maintainer to review your PR.

8. Make sure your PR follows our PR template (has to consist of a `Description`,
   `Test plan` and `Documentation update` sections)

### Commit Message Style

We follow a structured commit message format to ensure readability and enable
automated changelog generation.

#### Format

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

- **Header**: Follows the `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>` pattern

#### Type (Mandatory)

Must be one of the following:

| Type       | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `build`    | Changes affecting build system or dependencies |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts  |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                     |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                  |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                        |
| `refactor` | Code change with no bug fix or new feature     |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                     |

#### Scope (Optional)

The scope should indicate the area of the codebase affected.

#### Summary

- Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "change" not "changed")
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end

### Tips for a Quality Pull Request

- Title your PR to clearly describe the work done.

- Structure your description based on our PR template

- Link to the related issue, if applicable.

- Write a concise commit message summarizing the work.

### After Submitting Your PR

- We might ask questions, request more details, or ask for changes before
  merging your PR. This ensures clarity and smooth interaction.

- As you update your PR, resolve each conversation.

- Once approved, we will "squash-and-merge" to keep the commit history clean.

Thank you for your contributions!
