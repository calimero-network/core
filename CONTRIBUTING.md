# Contribution Guide

Thank you for dedicating your time to contribute to our project.

This guide outlines the contribution workflow to make the process smooth and effective for everyone.

Start by reading the README to understand the project better.

## Project Status

The project is actively being developed.

You can check out the open Issues, monitor the development progress, and contribute.

## Getting Started

There are several ways you can contribute:

- Solve open issues
- Report bugs or suggest features
- Enhance the documentation

Contributions are managed via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are some general guidelines:

- Before creating a new Issue or PR, search for [existing ones](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues).
- Contributions should focus on either functionality or style in the PR, not both.
- If you encounter an error, provide context. Explain what you are trying to do and how to reproduce the error.
- Follow the repositoryâ€™s formatting guidelines.
- Update the README.md file if your changes affect it.

## Issues

Use Issues to report problems, request features, or discuss changes before creating a PR.

### Solving an Issue

Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues) to find one that interests you.

If someone is already working on an issue, they will be assigned to it. If you want to work on an issue, you can assign it to yourself and then open a PR with your solution.

### Creating a New Issue

If no related issue exists, you can create a new one.

Here are some tips:

- Provide detailed context to make it clear for others.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue or the rationale for a new feature.
- Attach screenshots, videos, etc., if applicable.

## Pull Requests

### Pull Request Workflow

We use the ["fork-and-pull"](https://github.com/susam/gitpr) Git workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the project.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
4. Commit your changes to this new branch.
5. Push your changes to your fork.
6. Create a pull request from your fork to our repository. Use the "master" branch as the base branch.
7. Tag a maintainer to review your PR.

### Tips for a Quality Pull Request

- Title your PR to clearly describe the work done.
- Structure the description for easy reading, using bullet points and screenshots if necessary.
- Link to the related issue, if applicable.
- Write a concise commit message summarizing the work.

### After Submitting Your PR

- We might ask questions, request more details, or ask for changes before merging your PR. This ensures clarity and smooth interaction.
- As you update your PR, resolve each conversation.
- Once approved, we will "squash-and-merge" to keep the commit history clean.

Thank you for your contributions!
