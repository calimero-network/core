## Build Self-Sovereign Applications with CRDT-Powered P2P Sync

Calimero Network is a framework for building distributed, peer-to-peer applications with **automatic conflict-free data synchronization**, data ownership, and verifiable off-chain computing.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ DAG-based CRDT Sync - Automatic conflict resolution, works offline
- ✅ Event-driven Architecture - Real-time notifications across nodes
- ✅ Encrypted P2P - Secure data sharing with end-to-end encryption
- ✅ WASM Runtime - Write apps in Rust, compile to WebAssembly
- ✅ Multi-chain Integration - NEAR, ICP, Ethereum, Stellar, ZKSync
- ✅ Local-first - Your data, your node, your control

## Why Calimero?

**Data Ownership & Privacy** - Self-sovereign apps on user-controlled nodes with encrypted storage and selective sharing.

**Automatic Synchronization** - CRDT technology provides conflict-free merges, offline support, and causal ordering with eventual consistency.

**Verifiable Off-Chain Computing** - Efficient local consensus with cross-chain proof verification and horizontal scalability.

## Architecture

Calimero's architecture consists of four main layers:

1. **Application Layer** - WASM apps using the Calimero SDK
2. **Node Layer** - DAG-based delta synchronization and event handling
3. **Storage Layer** - CRDT storage with Merkle trees for efficient state comparison
4. **Network Layer** - P2P communication via libp2p (Gossipsub + Streams)

### How It Works

**Transaction Flow:**
1. Client calls WASM method → generates CRDT actions
2. Actions committed as DAG delta → broadcast via Gossipsub
3. Peers receive delta → apply to local state
4. Event handlers execute → UI updates in real-time

**Sync Flow:**
- Primary: Gossipsub broadcasts (100-200ms latency)
- Fallback: Periodic P2P sync (every 10-30s)
- Recovery: DAG buffering handles out-of-order delivery

For detailed architecture diagrams and flows, see:
- [Node Architecture](crates/node/readme/architecture.md) - Complete system design
- [Sync Protocol](crates/node/readme/sync-protocol.md) - Delta propagation details
- [DAG Architecture](crates/dag/readme/architecture.md) - Causal ordering system

### Core Components

#### 1. CRDT Storage

Conflict-free data types with automatic merging: `UnorderedMap`, `Vector`, `Counter`, and Merkle trees for state comparison.

**[→ Storage Documentation](crates/storage/README.md)** - Data types, merge semantics, and usage

#### 2. DAG-based Synchronization

Causal delta tracking with out-of-order handling, fork detection, and automatic cascade application.

**[→ DAG Documentation](crates/dag/README.md)** - DAG structure, algorithms, and performance  
**[→ Node Documentation](crates/node/README.md)** - Runtime integration and sync protocols  
**[→ Sync Configuration](crates/node/readme/sync-configuration.md)** - Tuning parameters

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

Real-time event emission, propagation, and handler execution across the network.

**[→ SDK Documentation](crates/sdk/README.md)** - API reference and examples  
**[→ Event Handling Guide](crates/node/readme/event-handling.md)** - Event flow and handlers

#### 4. P2P Networking

libp2p-based communication with Gossipsub broadcasts, reliable streams, DHT peer discovery, and Noise encryption.

**[→ Network Documentation](crates/network/README.md)** - Protocols and configuration

#### 5. Multi-Chain Integration

Cross-chain proof verification for NEAR Protocol, ICP, Ethereum, Stellar, and zkSync.

**[→ Contracts Directory](contracts/)** - Smart contracts for each chain

## Core Principles

1. **Data Ownership** - Your data on your devices, you control access
2. **Privacy by Default** - End-to-end encryption
3. **Distributed by Design** - P2P architecture, no single point of failure
4. **Developer-Friendly** - Simple API with powerful CRDT primitives

See [example applications](apps/) for working implementations.

## Performance

Calimero is designed for efficiency:

- **Latency**: 100-200ms delta propagation (Gossipsub)
- **Throughput**: 100-1000 deltas/sec per context
- **Memory**: ~10MB per context (1000 deltas)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal (more contexts = more throughput)
