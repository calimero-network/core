Calimero Network is a framework that enables building and running peer-to-peer Self-Sovereign applications focusing on data ownership, harnessing the power of verifiable off-chain computing and data ownership.

Calimero Network enables users to own their data. In the Web3 landscape, while you can own your money, data ownership and control over access are still lacking. Calimero addresses this gap by providing solutions for secure data storage and complete control over data access. Users deserve to know what happens on the backend level when using software. This transparency is a core reason why Calimero is open-source, making sense for an infra framework positioned as L0 for privacy and verifiable off-chain computing. 

Our architecture supports encrypted peer-to-peer communication, ensuring data privacy and security through advanced encryption methods. Calimero utilizes local storage and nodes, adopting a localized consensus model that enhances scalability and efficiency without compromising privacy.


## Why Calimero?

Calimero Network embodies a pioneering spirit, offering innovative solutions that disrupt the digital landscape. Our mission is to revolutionize data ownership principles, bringing control back to users. We aim to redefine privacy, security, and user autonomy through a robust framework that supports a diverse ecosystem of SSApps. Our vision is to become the L0 for privacy across all ecosystems and beyond. Calimero provides an easy-to-integrate solution that extends blockchain technology, offering an extra layer of security, privacy, and data ownership. Calimero enables verifiable off-chain computing, allowing for efficient and cost-effective computation by updating the state only for a selective group of peers within a context, rather than the entire network.

**Core Principles**
1. Values - the main values of Calimero are data ownership, privacy, data control, innovation, and simplicity.
2. Data Ownership and Access Control - SSApps work with encrypted user(peer) data: SSApps and their data are stored on a local storage(node), but have a synchronized state and can run on multiple devices. The data is kept secret from any person who does not have direct access provided by the owner. SSApps run only on user-trusted devices: a user can interact with an SSApp only after the application code and data arrives from encrypted decentralized storage and gets loaded into the trusted execution environment. Once the SSApps are loaded into the user-controlled device, they do not need to interact with any machine or server when offering functionality to the user.
3. Ethos - Calimero aims to make a significant impact and drive disruptive change within both Web2 and Web3. We are a catalyst for a secure, private, and user-centric digital world, standing as a testament to innovation and the pursuit of an equitable decentralized internet.

## Backstory

Calimero Network was born out of the need to solve major issues in existing technology and blockchain systems. We noticed big problems with privacy, data control, and scalability that had to be fixed. 

Inspired by the core ideas of decentralization, the Calimero team aimed to redesign decentralized applications (dApps). Our main focus was on ensuring user privacy, giving users control over their data, and improving access management. This mission fueled the creation of Calimero Network. 

Driven by innovation, Calimero developed special tools like the Protocol SDK and specialized nodes. These tools are meant to make decentralized applications more functional and secure. Calimero uses an integrated approach to manage decentralized identities (DIDs) within client nodes. This allows users to effectively and securely manage their digital footprint. Our journey is all about striving for a private, efficient, cost-effective, and open decentralized web. Our dedication to privacy and security sets new standards in the decentralized world, always putting user privacy and data control first.
