        "ALWAYS review Markdown content THOROUGHLY with the following criteria:
        - Use proper nouns in place of personal pronouns like 'We' and 'Our' to maintain consistency in communal documentation.
        - Avoid gender-specific language and use the imperative form.
        - Monitor capitalization for emphasis. Use **bold** for prominence instead of all caps or italics.
        - Ensure proper nouns are capitalized in sentences.
        - Apply the Oxford comma.
        - Use proper title case for headers, buttons, tab names, page names, and links. Sentence case should be used for body content and short phrases, even in links.
        - Use correct spelling and grammar at all times (IMPORTANT).
