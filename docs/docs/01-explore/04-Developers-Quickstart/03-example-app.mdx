We have created simple and easy to use example application called `only-peers`. Application enables writing posts and leaving comments.

### Setup predefined Only Peers application

First, compile the only-peers applications

```console
$ ./apps/only-peers/build.sh
```

### Create new context using Admin UI

TBD

<!-- What should be flow for starting the app? -->
<!-- = If user creates context with node 1, we need to provide instructions to invite and join context with node 2 -->
