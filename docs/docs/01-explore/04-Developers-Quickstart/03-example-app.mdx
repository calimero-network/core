We have created simple and easy to use example application called `only-peers`. Application enables writing posts and leaving comments.
To try out application you need to create new context where application will be installed.

### Create new context

Navigate back to Admin Dashboard. If you have not started Admin Dashboard, follow the instructions in [Admin Dashboard](./02-admin-dashboard.mdx).

- Follow context creation instructions and select `only-peers` app.

You are now part of the context and can start using the application. If you want others to join your context, follow instruction in [Invite To Context](./04-invite-to-context.mdx).
