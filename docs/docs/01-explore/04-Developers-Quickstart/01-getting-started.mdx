Using the main features of Calimero Network involves several components and processes tailored to developers looking to build decentralized, privacy-focused applications. Hereâ€™s an overview of how to engage with its core functionalities, along with examples of common use cases:

Example using predefined Only Peers application

1. Setup coordinator and 2 nodes
2. Build and register only-peers application
3. Interact with the application

### Setup coordinator and 2 nodes

#### First, compile the only-peers and kv-store applications

```console
$ ./apps/only-peers/build.sh
$ ./apps/kv-store/build.sh
```

#### Create a data folder for all configs

```console
$ mkdir data
```

#### Spin up coordinator node

```
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/coordinator init --server-port 2427
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/coordinator run --node-type coordinator
```

#### Spin up node 1 (separate terminal)

```
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/node1 init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/node1 run
```

#### Spin up node 2 (separate terminal)

```console
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/node2 init --server-port 2429 --swarm-port 2529
$ cargo run -p calimero-node -- --home data/node2 run
```

All nodes are now initialized and ready for use.

### Interaction with local storage

All configured node sessions will fall into interactive mode.

```console
Usage: [call|peers|pool|gc|store] [args]

> call <method> <JSON args>

Call a method on the app with the provided JSON args

> peers

Show a count of connected peers

> pool

Show the transaction pool

> gc

Evict all transactions in the transaction pool that are awaiting confirmation

> store

Print the DB state
```

2. Build and register application

To complete the process of building and registering the application for the Calimero Node, follow these steps:

- Write Smart Contract:

  Refer to the [NEAR documentation](https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/what-is) to write your smart contract. Ensure that your smart contract is functional and meets the requirements of your application.

- Compile Smart Contract:

  Once you've written your smart contract, compile it to a WebAssembly (wasm) file.

- Access Admin UI:

  Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:NODE_PORT/admin/. Replace NODE_PORT with the port number where your NEAR node is running.

- Follow Instructions on **Admin UI web application**:

  Once on the admin UI page, follow the provided instructions to add, upload, register and install your application. This process will involve uploading your compiled wasm file, configuring application settings, and completing any necessary steps.

- Finalize the proccess:

  After following the steps on the admin UI, ensure that your application is successfully installed and registered. Test its functionality to verify that it behaves as expected.

3. Interact with the application

Create new post

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "mutate",
  "params": {
    "applicationId": "{APPLICATION_ID}",
    "method": "create_post",
    "argsJson": {
      "title": "Your Post Title",
      "content": "Your Post Content"
    }
  },
  "id": "dontcare"
}' 'http://localhost:2428/jsonrpc'
```
