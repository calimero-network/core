Node is gated with authentication. In order to interact with the node from any app, you need to register a decentralized identity.
We have build an Admin Dashboard which is a web application designed to streamline the management of node states within your system. Seamlessly connected with the API provided by the Admin Client API, this user interface offers a user-friendly platform for overseeing and controlling various aspects of your node infrastructure.

### Run Admin Dashboard

Position to the Admin Dashboard directory

```console
 cd node-ui
```

Install dependencies

```console
 pnpm install
```

Build the app

```console
 pnpm build
```

Run the Admin Dashboard

```console
 pnpm start
```

Open your web browser and access admin dashboard on http://localhost:NODE_PORT/admin/.

> **_NOTE:_**
> Replace `NODE_PORT` with the `--server-port` value defined during node setup in [Getting-started](./01-getting-started.mdx)

You will see login page. On the first login, your selected wallet will be used as a root key to use further functionalities.
