We have created simple and easy to use example application called `only-peers`. Application enables writing posts and leaving comments.
To try out application you need to create new context where application will be installed.

### Create new context

Navigate back to Admin Dashboard. If you have not started Admin Dashboard, follow the instructions in [Admin Dashboard](./02-admin-dashboard.mdx).

- Follow context creation instructions and select `only-peers` app.

You are now part of the context and can start using the application.

<!-- If you want others to join your context, follow instruction in [Invite To Context](./04-invite-to-context.mdx). -->

### Try out Only-peers application

We have built and deployed a demo app so you can try it out immediately.

Navigate to https://calimero-network.github.io/only-peers-client/ to access app frontend.

You will be asked to setup the app by the adding the node url. It is the same url you used while starting the node in [Getting-started](./01-getting-started.mdx) `http://localhost:NODE_PORT`
After setting up node url, you will be asked to login.

> **_NOTE:_**
> Use your wallet which you have already added as root key in [Admin Dashboard. ](./02-admin-dashboard.mdx)

You are now ready to use the app. Enjoy!
