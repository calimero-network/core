### Inspect if your node is properly connected

Build the application to inspect node local storage.

```console
$ ./apps/kv-store/build.sh
```

All configured node sessions will fall into interactive mode which means you can interact with the node using the command line where node runs.

```console
Usage: [call|peers|pool|gc|store] [args]

> call <method> <JSON args>

Call a method on the app with the provided JSON args

> peers

Show a count of connected peers

> pool

Show the transaction pool

> gc

Evict all transactions in the transaction pool that are awaiting confirmation

> store

Print the DB state
```

Check how many peers your node see. Write `peers` in the node terminal.

```console
    peers
```
