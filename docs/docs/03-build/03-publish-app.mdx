After you have built your application, you can publish it to the network. This will make it available for users to interact with.

## Publishing application

Navigate to [Admin Dashboard](../explore/developers-quickstart/admin-dashboard) and select `Applications` tab.

![Publish application](/admin-dashboard/publish-new-application.png)

Enter required data and publish application. After publishing, your application will be available for users to interact with in new contexts.

## Application preview

Good practice allows users to try app before they decide to use it. You can deploy an app to any host provider.

We have used github pages to preview our [example app](../explore/developers-quickstart/example-app). You can do the same by following the steps below.

## Example app preview

First you need to enable github pages by following [Creating a github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Our example app is written in next.js and code is available in [only-peers-client](https://github.com/calimero-network/only-peers-client)
After enabling github pages, few changes are required in your next.js app.
`next.config.mjs` should contain output: "export" field

Github actions is used to automatize deployment process. You can find example in [github workflow](https://github.com/calimero-network/only-peers-client/tree/master/.github/workflows)
