### Runtime

Overview: The runtime environment of a client node in the Calimero Network is crucial for the execution of decentralized applications (DApps), particularly those compiled to WebAssembly (WASM).

Functionality:

- State Synchronization: Each node can download and synchronize the state with existing applications, ensuring that all nodes participating in a particular application network are consistent and up-to-date.
- Application Settings: Nodes can be configured with specific settings for each application, including which WASM modules to run, source URLs for fetching these modules, encryption protocols to be used, and more.
- Network Topology & Update Rules: Defines the structure of the network and how nodes communicate and update each other. Proper update rules are crucial for application security and integrity, particularly in a decentralized setting where trust is distributed.
