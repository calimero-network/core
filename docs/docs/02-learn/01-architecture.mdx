Calimero Network offers a robust framework for developing and running peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. Our framework allows users to participate in the network or build applications for others to use.

## Participate

User participate in the network with client node. By encapsulating the complexities of operating a client node, we aim to make it easy and intuitive for everyone to engage in the decentralized world.

- Client node acts as a gateway that runs applications and connects with other peers
- Each application is loaded and isolated from other applications into separate context. This ensures that each application runs independently while still allowing interactions through shared states or messages.
- Context consolidates all necessary components into a secure, isolated environment.

Some networks may require specialized functionalities, which are provided by a dedicated compute market. Users can integrate these special functionalities from a pool of available specialized nodes.

## Build

To develop applications on the Calimero Network, we provide comprehensive SDKs:

- Protocol SDK to define how the application should behave and communicate with the node.
- Client SDK to connect to node and use data in user interface and authenticate using wallets UI.

Developer applications are shared through application registry where developers upload their applications and share it with other users
