Welcome, developers! You're about to dive into the Calimero Network, a place designed to shake up the digital world by prioritizing what matters most: privacy, data control, and freedom in your creations.

#### Why Calimero?

Calimero offers a foundation for those committed to building the new digital landscape where privacy and user autonomy are non-negotiable. It's a shift towards an ecosystem where applications are built on principles of decentralization, ensuring users retain control over their digital footprint.

#### What's Inside?
- **[Calimero Node](/client-node)**: This is your gateway to the Calimero Network, where you can create apps that put privacy and control in the hands of your users.
- **[Calimero SDK](/calimero-sdk-rs)**: Define the framework for seamless interaction within the Calimero environment. With this toolkit, you shape the pathways through which your application maintains its state, reacts to state changes, and communicates within the network.
- **[TypeScript Client SDK](/client-ts-sdk)**: This ensures that apps can smoothly interact with your Calimero node.
- **[Specialized Nodes](/specialize-cluster)**: These nodes maintain the network's dedication to privacy and security, providing essential services like enhanced storage capacity and reliable data access, all designed to keep your projects both private and resilient.

We're big on keeping things between you and your usersâ€”no eavesdroppers. We make sure privacy isn't just a promise; it's baked into every [application network](/application-network).

#### Next steps
