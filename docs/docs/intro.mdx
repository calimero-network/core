Welcome, developers! You're about to dive into the Calimero Network, a place designed to shake up the digital world by prioritizing what matters most: privacy, data control, and freedom in your creations.

#### Why Calimero?

Calimero offers a foundation for those committed to building the new digital landscape where privacy and user autonomy are non-negotiable. It's a shift towards an ecosystem where applications are built on principles of decentralization, ensuring users retain control over their digital footprint.

#### What's Inside?
- **[Calimero Node](/docs/client-node)**: This is your gateway to the Calimero Network, where you can create apps that put privacy and control in the hands of your users.
- **[Protocol SDK](/docs/protocol-sdk)**: This is where you define how network participants communicate with others. It's like creating a secret handshake for your app that only those you choose can understand.
- **[TypeScript Client SDK](/docs/client-ts-sdk)**: This ensures that apps can smoothly interact with your Calimero node.
- **[Specialized Nodes](/docs/specialize-cluster)**: These nodes maintain the network's dedication to privacy and security, providing essential services like enhanced storage capacity and reliable data access, all designed to keep your projects both private and resilient.

We're big on keeping things between you and your usersâ€”no eavesdroppers. We make sure privacy isn't just a promise; it's baked into every [application network](/docs/application-network).

#### Next steps

Ready to embark on this journey? For developers, the adventure starts with our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started), where you'll learn to craft and launch your first decentralized network. Together, let's commit to building a digital future that respects privacy at every turn.

Let's get building. Welcome to Calimero Network!
