### About Admin UI

The Admin UI is a web application designed to streamline the management of node states within your system. Seamlessly connected with the API provided by the **[Admin Client API](/docs/admin-client-api)**, this user interface offers a user-friendly platform for overseeing and controlling various aspects of your node infrastructure.

### How to Use

To access the Admin UI, simply navigate to `http://<node_url>/admin` in your web browser. Once logged in, you'll gain access to a comprehensive set of tools and features for managing your node infrastructure

### Usage

1. **Login page**

   The Login Page initiates the authentication process by calling the /request-challenge endpoint. This endpoint generates a challenge that is then signed along with the user's message using their wallet.

2. **Add root key**

   The "Add Root Key" feature facilitates the addition of a root key to the node. This process involves sending parameters such as signature, public key, account ID, and callback URL to the /root-key API endpoint, which is hosted by the Admin API.
