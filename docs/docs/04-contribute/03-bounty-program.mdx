# Bounty Program

We're excited to announce that Calimero will soon be launching a bounty program! This program is designed to reward contributors who help us tackle various issues and enhance our project.

## What is a Bounty Program?

A bounty program is an initiative where contributors can earn rewards for completing specific tasks or resolving issues. These tasks can range from fixing bugs to adding new features, improving documentation, or optimizing performance. The rewards can vary and may include monetary compensation, swag, exclusive access to new features, or public recognition.

## How it Works

While we are still in the process of finalizing the details of our bounty program, hereâ€™s an overview of how it will function:

1. **Identify Bounty Issues:** We will mark specific [issues](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues) in our repository with a "bounty" label. These issues will be eligible for rewards.
2. **Contribute:** Choose a bounty-labeled issue that interests you, solve it, and submit a pull request.
3. **Review:** Our team will review your contribution. If your solution meets the requirements and quality standards, it will be merged.
4. **Reward:** Once the issue is resolved and your contribution is accepted, you will receive a reward. The exact nature of the reward will be specified in the issue description.

### Exceptional Contributions

While not all issues may be marked with a bounty label, we recognize that exceptional solutions deserve recognition. If you provide a particularly outstanding solution to an issue not marked as a bounty, we may still decide to reward your contribution.


## Stay Tuned

We are currently refining the details of our bounty program, including the reward system. Follow us on social media and keep an eye on our announcements to be the first to know when the bounty program goes live.

Thank you for your patience and continued support. We look forward to collaborating with you and rewarding your valuable contributions!
