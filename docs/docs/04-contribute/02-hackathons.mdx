# Hackathons

At Calimero, we love innovation and collaboration, which is why we plan to regularly organize hackathons that include our product. We have exciting events planned for the future. Stay tuned by following us on our social media channels to get the latest updates.

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is an event where developers, designers, and other tech enthusiasts come together to create innovative solutions in a short amount of time. Participants work in teams to build projects, often centered around a specific theme or technology. Hackathons are a great opportunity to:

- **Learn New Skills:** Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, hackathons provide a platform to learn new technologies and tools.
- **Collaborate:** Work with other passionate individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.
- **Showcase Your Talent:** Present your project to a panel of judges and other participants, winning prizes and recognition.
- **Network:** Meet like-minded individuals, industry experts, and potential employers or collaborators.

1. **Register for the Event:** Sign up through the event link provided in our announcements.
2. **Form a Team:** Join with friends or team up with other participants.
