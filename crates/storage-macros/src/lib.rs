/// Derives the [`AtomicUnit`](calimero_storage::entities::AtomicUnit) trait for
/// a struct.
///
/// This macro automatically implements the [`AtomicUnit`](calimero_storage::entities::AtomicUnit)
/// trait for a struct, which extends the [`Data`](calimero_storage::entities::Data)
/// trait.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// The following are mandatory requirements for the struct:
///
///   - A private `storage` field of type [`Element`](calimero_storage::entities::Element).
///     This is needed as the [`Data`](calimero_storage::entities::Data)-based
///     struct needs to own an [`Element`](calimero_storage::entities::Element).
///
/// # Generated implementations
///
/// This macro will generate the following implementations:
///
///   - [`Data`](calimero_storage::entities::Data) trait implementation.
///   - [`AtomicUnit`](calimero_storage::entities::AtomicUnit) trait
///     implementation.
///   - Getter and setter methods for each field. These help to ensure that the
///     access to the fields is controlled, and that any changes to the fields
///     are reflected in the [`Element`](calimero_storage::entities::Element)'s
///     state.
///   - [`BorshSerialize`](borsh::BorshSerialize) and [`BorshDeserialize`](borsh::BorshDeserialize)
///     will be implemented for the struct, so they should be omitted from the
///     struct definition.
///
/// # Struct attributes
///
/// * `#[root]`       - Indicates that the type represents a root in the
///                     hierarchy, and doesn't have a parent. This is an
///                     optional attribute.
/// * `#[type_id(n)]` - Indicates the type ID for the struct. This is a
///                     mandatory attribute, and the value `n` must be a `u8`.
///                     This is used to differentiate between different types
///                     of structs when deserialising, and each type should have
///                     a unique ID.
///
/// # Field attributes
///
/// * `#[collection]` - Indicates that the field is a collection of other
///                     [`Data`] types.
/// * `#[private]`    - Designates fields that are local-only, and so should not
///                     be shared with other nodes in the network. These fields
///                     will not be serialised or included in the Merkle hash
///                     calculation. Note that being local-only is not the same
///                     as applying permissions via ACLs to share with only the
///                     current user — these fields are not shared at all.
/// * `#[skip]`       - Can be applied to fields that should not be serialised
///                     or included in the Merkle hash calculation. These fields
///                     will be completely ignored by the storage system, and
///                     not even have getters and setters implemented.
/// * `#[storage]`    - Indicates that the field is the storage element for the
///                     struct. This is a mandatory field, and if it is missing,
///                     there will be a panic during compilation. The name is
///                     arbitrary, but the type has to be an [`Element`](calimero_storage::entities::Element).
///
/// Note that fields marked with `#[private]` or `#[skip]` must have [`Default`]
/// implemented so that they can be initialised when deserialising.
///
/// TODO: The `#[private]` attribute is implemented with the same functionality
///       as `#[skip]`, but in future these will be differentiated.
///
/// # Getters and setters
///
/// The macro will generate getter and setter methods for each field. These
/// methods will allow the struct to control access to its fields, and ensure
/// that any changes to the fields are reflected in the [`Element`](calimero_storage::entities::Element)'s
/// state.
///
/// The getter methods will have the same name as the field, and the setter
/// methods will be prefixed with `set_`. For example, given a field `name`, the
/// getter method will be `name()`, and the setter method will be `set_name()`.
///
/// The setter methods will return a boolean indicating whether the update was
/// carried out. Note that this is more an indication of change than it is of
/// error — if the value is the same as the current value, the update will not
/// be carried out, and the method will return `false`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use calimero_storage::entities::Element;
/// use calimero_storage_macros::AtomicUnit;
/// use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};
///
/// #[derive(AtomicUnit, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
/// #[type_id(43)]
/// struct Page {
///     title: String,
///     #[private]
///     secret: String,
///     #[storage]
///     storage: Element,
/// }
/// ```
///

/// use calimero_storage::entities::Element;
/// use calimero_storage_macros::{AtomicUnit, Collection};
/// use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};

/// #[type_id(44)]
/// struct Person {
///     name: String,
///     age: u32,
///     #[private]
///     secret: String,
///     #[collection]
///     friends: Friends,
///     #[storage]
///     storage: Element,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Collection, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
/// #[children(Person)]
/// struct Friends;
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This macro will panic during compilation if:
///
///   - It is applied to anything other than a struct
///   - The struct has unnamed fields
///   - The struct does not have a field annotated as `#[storage]`
///   - The struct has fields with types that do not implement [`Default`]
///   - The struct already has methods with the same names as the generated
///     getter and setter methods
///
/// # See also
///
/// * [`Collection`] - For defining a collection of child elements, for use with
///                    [`AtomicUnit`] (the parent and children are all atomic
///                    units, with the collection being the grouping mechanism
///                    at field level on the parent).
