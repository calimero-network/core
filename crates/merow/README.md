# Core Cli Wrapper (crate::merow) 

A CLI wrapper for setting up a Calimero Node that provides a custom node configuration file for initializing and running a node. 

*This project is forked from the [original core repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/core) from the Calimero Network, and actively syncs the fork at midnight.*   
## Features

- Custom Node Configuration File 
- Simple Commands to Initialize and Run a Calimero Node 
- Creates a Node Home Directory at the root (if it doesn't already exist)

## Prerequisites
- Rust:  [Official Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Setting up
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kevinjaypatel/core.git 
```

Change to repo  

```bash
  cd core 
```

## Usage

Setup the Default Configuration:  `./crates/merow/config/default.toml` 

```javascript
[node] 
name = "node1"        // name of the node 
server_port = 2428    // server port for admin dashboard 
swarm_port = 2528     // swarm port 
home = "data"         // name of the home directory 
```

Initialize a node   
`$ merow -- init-node` 

Start a running node   
`$ merow -- start-node` 


## How to Run (from project root)

### Build the Rust Package
```bash
  cargo build 
```

### Starting up a Node 
E.g. Initializes Node (with defaults) 
```bash
  cargo run -p merow -- init-node 
```

Start a running node 
```bash
  cargo run -p merow -- start-node 
```

### Accessing the node via Admin Dashboard
```bash
  http://localhost:<node.server_port>/admin-dashboard/
```

## Issues 
- Standard I/O for handling the Calimero Node during runtime

#### Ideas for Contributions: 
- Standard I/O handling: Implement support for standard input/output handling for the Calimero Node during runtime using the CLI wrapper.
- Tab completion: Add support for tab completion to enhance the user experience.
- Admin Dashboard deployment: Develop a feature to deploy the Admin Dashboard upon successfully starting the node.
- Error handling: Improve error handling to ensure a node is initialized and started successfully.
- Multi-node deployment: Implement support for deploying multiple nodes (e.g., node1, node2, ... nodeN).
