//! Generic CRDT property tests.
//!
//! Every collection that implements [`Mergeable`] (or one of the shape sub-traits
//! [`CrdtMap`], [`CrdtSequence`], [`CrdtSet`]) is exercised here through the trait
//! surface only — no per-type tests. The CRDT laws checked are:
//!
//! - **Idempotency:** `merge(a, a) == a` (merging a value with itself is a no-op).
//! - **Commutativity:** `merge(a, b) == merge(b, a)` (order doesn't matter).
//! - **Associativity:** `merge(merge(a, b), c) == merge(a, merge(b, c))` (grouping doesn't matter).
//!
//! Together these guarantee convergence: any set of replicas applying the same
//! set of updates in any order reaches the same final state.
