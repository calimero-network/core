//! Interface for the storage system.
//!
//! This module contains the interface for the storage system, which provides
//! the basics of loading and saving data, but presents a number of helper
//! methods and additional functionality to abstract away common operations.
//!
//! This follows the repository pattern, where the interface is the primary
//! means of interacting with the storage system, rather than the ActiveRecord
//! pattern where the model is the primary means of interaction.
//!
