//! Interface for the storage system.
//!
//! This module contains the interface for the storage system, which provides
//! the basics of loading and saving data, but presents a number of helper
//! methods and additional functionality to abstract away common operations.
//!
//! This follows the repository pattern, where the interface is the primary
//! means of interacting with the storage system, rather than the ActiveRecord
//! pattern where the model is the primary means of interaction.
//!
//! # Synchronisation
//!
//! There are two main mechanisms involved in synchronisation:
//!
//!   1. **Direct changes**: When a change is made locally, the resulting
//!      actions need to be propagated to other nodes.
//!   2. **Comparison**: When a comparison is made between two nodes, the
//!      resulting actions need to be taken to bring the nodes into sync.
//!
//! The entry points for synchronisation are therefore either the
//! [`apply_action()`](Interface::apply_action()) method, to carry out actions;
//! or the [`compare_trees()`](Interface::compare_trees()) method, to compare
//! two nodes, which will emit actions to pass to [`apply_action()`](Interface::apply_action())
//! on either the local or remote node, or both.
//!
//! ## CRDT model
//!
//! Calimero primarily uses operation-based CRDTs, also called commutative
//! replicated data types (CmRDTs). This means that the order of operations does
//! not matter, and the outcome will be the same regardless of the order in
//! which the operations are applied.
//!
//! It is worth noting that the orthodox CmRDT model does not feature or require
//! a comparison activity, as there is an operating assumption that all updates
//! have been carried out fully and reliably.
//!
//! The alternative CRDT approach is state-based, also called convergent
//! replicated data types (CvRDTs). This is a comparison-based approach, but the
//! downside is that this model requires the full state to be transmitted
//! between nodes, which can be costly. Although this approach is easier to
//! implement, and fits well with gossip protocols, it is not as efficient as
//! the operation-based model.
//!
//! The standard choice therefore comes down to:
//!
//!   - Use CmRDTs and guarantee that all updates are carried out fully and
//!     reliably, are not dropped or duplicated, and are replayed in causal
//!     order.
//!   - Use CvRDTs and accept the additional bandwidth cost of transmitting the
//!     full state for every single CRDT.
//!
//! It does not fit the Calimero objectives to transmit the entire state for
//! every update, but there is also no guarantee that all updates will be
//! carried out fully and reliably. Therefore, Calimero uses a hybrid approach
//! that represents the best of both worlds.
//!
//! In the first instance, operations are emitted (in the form of [`Action`]s)
//! whenever a change is made. These operations are then propagated to other
//! nodes, where they are executed. This is the CmRDT model.
//!
//! However, there are cases where a node may have missed an update, for
//! instance, if it was offline. In this case, the node will be out of sync with
//! the rest of the network. To bring the node back into sync, a comparison is
//! made between the local node and a remote node, and the resulting actions are
//! executed. This is the CvRDT model.
//!
//! The storage system maintains a set of Merkle hashes, which are stored
//! against each element, and represent the state of the element and its
//! children. The Merkle hash for an element can therefore be used to trivially
//! determine whether an element or any of its descendants have changed,
//! without actually needing to compare every entity in the tree.
//!
//! Therefore, when a comparison is carried out it is not a full state
//! comparison, but a comparison of the immediate data and metadata of given
//! element(s). This is sufficient to determine whether the nodes are in sync,
//! and to generate the actions needed to bring them into sync. If there is any
//! deviation detected, the comparison will recurse into the children of the
//! element(s) in question, and generate further actions as necessary — but this
//! will only ever examine those descendent entities for which the Merkle hash
//! differs.
//!
//! We can therefore summarise this position as being: Calimero uses a CmRDT
//! model for direct changes, and a CvRDT model for comparison as a fallback
//! mechanism to bring nodes back into sync when needed.
//!
//! ## Direct changes
//!
//! When a change is made locally, the resulting actions need to be propagated
//! to other nodes. An action list will be generated, which can be made up of
//! [`Add`](Action::Add), [`Delete`](Action::Delete), and [`Update`](Action::Update)
//! actions. These actions are then propagated to all the other nodes in the
//! network, where they are executed using the [`apply_action()`](Interface::apply_action())
//! method.
//!
//! This is a straightforward process, as the actions are known and are fully
//! self-contained without any wider impact. Order does not strictly matter, as
//! the actions are commutative, and the outcome will be the same regardless of
//! the order in which they are applied. Any conflicts are handled using the
//! last-write-wins strategy.
//!
//! There are certain cases where a mis-ordering of action, which is
//! essentially the same as having missing actions, can result in an invalid
//! state. For instance, if a child is added before the parent, the parent will
//! not exist and the child will be orphaned. In this situation we can either
//! ignore the child, or we can block its addition until the parent has been
//! added, or we can store it as an orphaned entity to be resolved later. At
//! present we follow the last approach, as it aligns well with the use of
//! comparisons to bring nodes back into sync. We therefore know that the node
//! will _eventually_ become consistent, which is all we guarantee.
//!
//! TODO: Examine whether this is the right approach, or whether we should for
//! TODO: instance block and do a comparison on the parent to ensure that local
//! TODO: state is as consistent as possible.
//!
//! Providing all generated actions are carried out, all nodes will eventually
//! be in sync, without any need for comparisons, transmission of full states,
//! or a transaction model (which requires linear history, and therefore
//! becomes mathematically unsuitable for large distributed systems).
//!
//! ## Comparison
//!
//! There are a number of situations under which a comparison may be needed:
//!
//!   1. A node has missed an update, and needs to be brought back into sync
//!      (i.e. there is a gap in the instruction set).
//!   2. A node has been offline, and needs to be brought back into sync (i.e.
//!      all instructions since a certain point have been missed).
//!   3. A discrepancy has been detected between two nodes, and they need to be
//!      brought back into sync.
//!
//! A comparison is primarily triggered from a catch-up as a proactive measure,
//! i.e. without knowing if any changes exist, but can also arise at any point
//! if a discrepancy is detected.
//!
//! When performing a comparison, the data we have is the result of the entity
//! being serialised by the remote note, passed to us, and deserialised, so it
//! should be comparable in structure to having loaded it from the local
//! database.
//!
//! We therefore have access to the data and metadata, which includes the
//! immediate fields of the entity (i.e. the [`AtomicUnit`](crate::entities::AtomicUnit))
//! and also a list of the children.
//!
//! The stored list of children contains their Merkle hashes, thereby allowing
//! us to check all children in one operation instead of needing to load each
//! child in turn, as that would require remote data for each child, and that
//! would not be as efficient.
//!
//!   - If a child exists on both sides and the hash is different, we recurse
//!     into a comparison for that child.
//!
//!   - If a child is missing on one side then we can go with the side that has
//!     the latest parent and add or remove the child.
//!
//! Notably, in the case of there being a missing child, the resolution
//! mechanism does expose a small risk of erroneous outcome. For instance, if
//! the local node has had a child added, and has been offline, and the parent
//! has been updated remotely — in this situation, in the absence of any other
//! activity, a comparison (e.g. a catch-up when coming back online) would
//! result in losing the child, as the remote node would not have the child in
//! its list of children. This edge case should usually be handled by the
//! specific add and remove events generated at the time of the original
//! activity, which should get propagated independently of a sync. However,
//! there are three extended options that can be implemented:
//!
//!   1. Upon catch-up, any local list of actions can be held and replayed
//!      locally after synchronisation. Alone, this would not correct the
//!      situation, due to last-write-wins rules, but additional logic could be
//!      considered for this particular situation.
//!   2. During or after performing a comparison, all local children for an
//!      entity can be loaded by path and checked against the parent's list of
//!      children. If there are any deviations then appropriate action can be
//!      taken. This does not fully cater for the edge case, and again would not
//!      correct the situation on its own, but additional logic could be added.
//!   3. A special kind of "deleted" element could be added to the system, which
//!      would store metadata for checking. This would be beneficial as it would
//!      allow differentiation between a missing child and a deleted child,
//!      which is the main problem exposed by the edge case. However, although
//!      this represents a full solution from a data mechanism perspective, it
//!      would not be desirable to store deleted entries permanently. It would
//!      be best combined with a cut-off constraint, that would limit the time
//!      period in which a catch-up can be performed, and after which the
//!      deleted entities would be purged. This does add complexity not only in
//!      the effect on the wider system of implementing that constraint, but
//!      also in the need for garbage collection to remove the deleted entities.
//!      This would likely be better conducted the next time the parent entity
//!      is updated, but there are a number of factors to consider here.
//!   4. Another way to potentially handle situations of this nature is to
//!      combine multiple granular updates into an atomic group operation that
//!      ensures that all updates are applied together. However, this remains to
//!      be explored, as it may not fit with the wider system design.
//!
//! Due to the potential complexity, this edge case is not currently mitigated,
//! but will be the focus of future development.
//!
//! TODO: Assess the best approach for handling this edge case in a way that
//! TODO: fits with the wider system design, and add extended tests for it.
//!
//! The outcome of a comparison is that the calling code receives a list of
//! actions, which can be [`Add`](Action::Add), [`Delete`](Action::Delete),
//! [`Update`](Action::Update), and [`Compare`](Action::Compare). The first
//! three are the same as propagating the consequences of direct changes, but
//! the comparison action is a special case that arises when a child entity is
//! found to differ between the two nodes, whereupon the comparison process
//! needs to recursively descend into the parts of the subtree found to differ.
//!
//! The calling code is then responsible for going away and obtaining the
//! information necessary to carry out the next comparison action if there is
//! one, as well as relaying the generated action list.
