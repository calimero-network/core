/// Represents an [`Element`] in the storage.
///
/// This is a simple model of an [`Element`] in the storage system, with a
/// unique identifier and a path to the [`Element`] in the hierarchy. Together,
/// these properties give the means of addressing that are necessary in order to
/// locate the [`Element`] and apply updates.
///
/// Note, this is modelled as a single entity called "Element" rather than
/// separating into separate "Node" and "Leaf" entities, to simplify the
/// handling via the storage [`Interface`](crate::interface::Interface). The
/// actual nature of the [`Element`] can be determined by inspection.
///
/// # Updates
///
/// When an [`Element`] is updated, the [`Element`] is marked as dirty, and the
/// [`updated_at()`](Element::updated_at()) timestamp is updated. This is used
/// to determine the freshness of the data, and to resolve conflicts when
/// multiple parties are updating the same [`Element`] concurrently, on a "last
/// write wins" basis.
///
/// An [`Element`] is considered to be an atomic unit, but this designation
/// applies only to it, and not its children. Its children are separate
/// entities, and are not part of the "state" of an [`Element`] for update
/// comparison purposes. However, they do matter for calculating the Merkle tree
/// hashes that represent the sum of all data at that part in the hierarchy and
/// below.
///
/// # Structure
///
/// TODO: Update when the `child_ids` field is replaced with an index.
///
/// At present the [`Element`] has a `child_ids` field, which memoises the IDs
/// of the children. This is because it is better than traversing the whole
/// database to find the children (!).
///
/// Having a `child_ids` field is however non-optimal — this should come from
/// outside the struct. We should be able to look up the children by path, and
/// so given that the path is the primary method of determining that an
/// [`Element`] is a child of another, this should be the mechanism relied upon.
/// Therefore, maintaining a list of child IDs is a second point of maintenance
/// and undesirable, as well as being restrictive for larger child sets.
///
/// An index would be a better approach, but this will be done later, as that is
/// purely an optimisation aspect and not a functional one, and it is better to
/// get the shape of the functionality correct, working, and testable first.
///
/// Given that we do need to obtain the children, and given also that indexes
/// are a later optimisation, the best interim approach is therefore to simply
/// store the child IDs against the struct.
///
/// This reasoning is, however, why we do not have a parent ID field. The path
/// should be sufficient to determine the parent, and so a parent ID is
/// redundant. It is also another point of maintenance and data to keep
/// consistent. For instance, moving an item in the tree should be as simple as
/// updating the path and recalculating affected [`Element`]s' hashes. If there
/// is a parent ID then that also has to be synced, and that does not give us
/// anything that we cannot already get via the path.
///
/// There are approaches that work with relational database when storing
/// hierarchies, such as BetterNestedSet to combine a NestedSet (with left and
/// right partitioning) with an AdjacencyList (parent IDs). However, operations
/// to update things like that are fast in relational databases but slow in
/// key-value stores. Therefore, this approach and other similar patterns are
/// not suitable for our use case.
