//! Entities for the storage system.
//!
//! This module contains the entities that are used to represent the elements in
//! the storage system. These are the building blocks that are used to construct
//! the hierarchy of the storage, and to apply updates to the elements.
//!
//! # Design: Elements, data, and atomic units
//!
//! There are a number of requirements that need to be catered for by the
//! solution, and it is worth exploring some of the possible structures and
//! approaches that have been considered.
//!
//! ## Considerations
//!
//! Let's examine first principles:
//!
//!   1. `Element`s are saved, and `Element`s are structs, with system metadata.
//!   2. `Element`s also contain user data, represented by `Data`.
//!   3. User types need to have an easy interface, using an `AtomicUnit`
//!      annotation.
//!
//! It is possible that `Element` should be a trait, and that the `AtomicUnit`
//! trait should be a superset of `Element`, and that the `AtomicUnit` proc
//! macro would then apply both `Element` and `AtomicUnit`. However, this would
//! still need a `Data` struct to be constructed, owned by the `Element`.
//!
//! Therefore, if we say that `Element` remains a struct, for simplicity, then
//! what exactly is being annotated? If the user creates a `Person`, is that
//! `Person` an `Element` or an `AtomicUnit`?
//!
//! It seems that the `Person` must be an `AtomicUnit`, which means it cannot
//! *be* `Data` with this structure, as it would need to *contain* `Data`. Now,
//! it initially seemed that `AtomicUnit` should extend `Data`. But if
//! `AtomicUnit` is the `Data`, then the `Person` annotation would be misleading
//! if it was applying to the internal `Data` and not to the `Person`. This
//! would not be idiomatic nor a good pattern to follow.
//!
//! So... if the `Person` is in fact the `AtomicUnit`, and it has data fields,
//! where do we get `Data` from now? We can't really have `Data` being an
//! `Element`, so `Data` has to be owned by `Element`, and where does the
//! `Element` come from?
//!
//! The relationship between these entities is critical to get right. As much as
//! possible of the internals should be abstracted away from the user, with the
//! presented interface being as simple as possible.
//!
//! ## Option One
//!
//!   - `Person` is an `AtomicUnit`.
//!   - `Person` defines fields — some marked as private.
//!   - To satisfy `AtomicUnit`, `Person` has a `storage` field added.
//!   - `Person.storage` is an `Element`, and contains a `PersonData` struct.
//!   - `PersonData` is constructed by the macro, and contains a copy of the
//!     fields from `Person` that are not private. These fields could
//!     potentially be borrowed, referencing the fields on the `Element`.
//!   - It's then unclear if `Person` (i.e. `AtomicUnit`) needs a `save()`
//!     method, or whether it should be passed to `Interface`.
//!
//! This suffers from a number of issues, including:
//!
//!   - The `Person` is now a leaky abstraction, as it exposes the internals of
//!     the `Element` and `PersonData`.
//!   - The `Person` is now a pain to work with, as it has to be constructed in
//!     a specific way, including the construction of `PersonData`.
//!   - The very existence of `PersonData` is icky.
//!
//! ## Option Two
//!
//!   - `Person` is an `AtomicUnit`.
//!   - `Person` defines fields — some marked as private.
//!   - `Element` becomes a trait instead of a struct.
//!   - `AtomicUnit` demands `Element`.
//!   - `Person` is now therefore an `Element`.
//!   - `Person.data` contains a `PersonData` struct.
//!   - `PersonData` is constructed by the macro, and contains a copy of the
//!     fields from `Person` that are not private. Again, these fields could
//!     potentially be borrowed, referencing the fields on the `Element`.
//!   - `Person` does not appear to need a `save()` now, as `Interface.save()`
//!     accepts `Element`, and therefore `Person`.
//!
//! This is also problematic:
//!
//!   - The `Element` has a lot on it, which clutters up the `Person`.
//!   - It exposes the internals, which is undesirable.
//!
//! ## Option Three
//!
//!   - `Person` is an `AtomicUnit`.
//!   - `Person` defines fields — some marked as private.
//!   - `Element` remains a struct.
//!   - `Interface` accepts `Data` not `Element`.
//!   - `AtomicUnit` extends `Data`.
//!   - `Person` is therefore `Data`.
//!   - `Person` has a `storage` field added, to hold an `Element`.
//!   - A circular reference is carefully created between `Person` and
//!     `Element`, with `Element` holding a weak reference to `Person`, and
//!     `Person` having a strong reference to (or ownership of) `Element`.
//!   - When accepting `Data`, i.e. a `Person` here, the `Interface` can call
//!     through `Person.storage` to get to the `Element`, and the `Element` can
//!     access the `Data` through the [`Weak`](std::sync::Weak).
//!   - The macro does not need to create another struct, and the saving logic
//!     can skip the fields marked as private.
//!   - `Person` does not appear to need a `save()`, as `Interface.save()` does
//!     not need to be changed.
//!
//! The disadvantages of this approach are:
//!
//!   - The circular reference is a bit of a pain, and could be a source of
//!     bugs.
//!   - In order to achieve the circular reference, the `Element` would need to
//!     wrap the `Data` in a [`Weak`](std::sync::Weak), which means that all use
//!     of the `Data` would need to be through the reference-counted pointer,
//!     which implies wrapping `Data` in an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) upon
//!     construction.
//!   - In order to gain mutability, some kind of mutex or read-write lock would
//!     be required. Imposing a predetermined mutex type would be undesirable,
//!     as the user may have their own requirements. It's also an annoying
//!     imposition.
//!   - Due to the `Data` (i.e. `Person`) being wrapped in an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc),
//!     [`Default`] cannot be implemented.
//!
//! ## Option Four
//!
//!   - `Person` is an `AtomicUnit`.
//!   - `Person` defines fields — some marked as private.
//!   - `Element` remains a struct.
//!   - `Interface` accepts `Data` not `Element`.
//!   - `AtomicUnit` extends `Data`.
//!   - `Person` is therefore `Data`.
//!   - `Person` has a `storage` field added, to hold (and own) an `Element`.
//!   - When accepting `Data`, i.e. a `Person` here, the `Interface` can call
//!     through `Person.storage` to get to the `Element`.
//!   - The macro does not need to create another struct, and the saving logic
//!     can skip the fields marked as private.
//!   - `Person` does not appear to need a `save()`, as `Interface.save()` does
//!     not need to be changed.
//!
//! This is essentially the same as Option Three, but without the circular
//! reference. The disadvantages are:
//!
//!   - There is no way for the `Element` to access the `Data` directly. This
//!     forces a different approach to those operations that require `Data`.
//!   - The `Element`'s operations can accept a `Data` instead of looking it up
//!     directly, but this loses structural assurance of the relationship.
//!
//! Passing the `Data` to the `Element`'s operations does work around the first
//! issue, albeit in a slightly unwieldy way. The second issue can be mitigated
//! by performing a check that the `Element` owned by the passed-in `Data` is
//! the same instance as the `Element` that the operation is being called on.
//! Although this is a runtime logic check, it is a simple one, and can be
//! entirely contained within the internal logic, which remains unexposed.
//!
//! ## Option Five
//!
//! For the sake of completeness, it's worth noting that technically another
//! option would be to use generics, such as `Element<D: Data>`, but this leads
//! to unnecessary complexity at this stage (including the potential to have to
//! use phantom data), with no tangible benefits. Therefore this has not been
//! discussed in detail here, although it has been carefully considered.
//!
//! ## Conclusion
//!
//! Option Four is the approach chosen, as it balances all of the following
//! aspirations:
//!
//!   - Simple to use.
//!   - Allows full ownership and mutability of the user's types.
//!   - Abstracts all storage functionality to the storage internals.
//!   - Achieves reliability.
//!   - Allows implementation of [`Default`] and similar without unexpected
//!     constraints.
//!   - Does not clutter the user's types.
//!   - Does not expose the internals of the storage system.
//!   - Does not require a circular reference.
//!   - Does not impose a mutex type.
//!   - Does not force a predetermined mutex type.
//!   - Does not require a separate struct to be constructed.
//!   - Does not require references to, or clones of, saved data.
//!
//! Not having a reference back to the `Data` from the `Element` is a slight
//! trade-off, but it is a small one, sacrificing a little structural assurance
//! and direct access for a simpler design with fewer impositions. The internal
//! validation check is simple, and it is best to promote the elegance of the
//! user interface over that of the internals — if there are a couple of hoops
//! to jump through then it is best for these to be in the library code.
//!
//! # Design: Collections
//!
//! There are three main ways to implement the collection functionality, i.e.
//! where a parent [`Element`] has children. These are:
//!
//!   1. **Struct-based**: Annotate the struct as being a `Collection`, meaning
//!      it can then have children. In this situation the child type is supplied
//!      as an associated type. This is the most straightforward approach, but
//!      it does not allow for the parent to have multiple types of children.
//!
//!   2. **Enum-based**: E.g. `enum ChildType { Page(Page), Author(Author) }`.
//!      This is more flexible, but it requires a match to determine the child
//!      type, and although the type formality is good in some ways, it adds
//!      a level of complexity and maintenance that is not desirable.
//!
//!   3. **Field-based**: E.g. `entity.pages` and `entity.authors` annotated as
//!      `Collection`, with some way to look up which fields are needed. This is
//!      the most flexible, and the easiest developer interface to use.
//!
//! The approach taken is Option 3, for the reasons given above.
//!

/// entities, and are not part of the "state" of an [`Element`] for update
/// comparison purposes. However, they do matter for calculating the Merkle tree
/// hashes that represent the sum of all data at that part in the hierarchy and
/// below.
///
/// # Internal structure
///
/// The primary data for the [`Element`], that is, the data that the consumer
/// application has stored in the [`Element`], cannot be directly accessed by
/// the [`Element`]. This is because that data is the focus of the user
/// operations, and it is desirable to keep the [`Element`] as entirely
/// self-contained. Therefore [`Data`] contains an [`Element`], purely to
/// promote this focus and separation.
///
/// For this reason, any [`Element`] methods that require access to the primary
/// data require the [`Data`] to be passed in, and need to check and ensure that
/// the [`Element`] owned by the [`Data`] is the same instance as the
/// [`Element`] that the operation is being called on.
///
/// # Storage structure
///
/// TODO: Update when the `child_info` field is replaced with an index.
///
/// At present the [`Data`] trait has a `child_info` field, which memoises the
/// IDs and Merkle hashes of the children. This is because it is better than
/// traversing the whole database to find the children (!).
///
/// Having a `child_info` field is however non-optimal — this should come from
/// outside the struct. We should be able to look up the children by path, and
/// so given that the path is the primary method of determining that an
/// [`Element`] is a child of another, this should be the mechanism relied upon.
/// Therefore, maintaining a list of child IDs is a second point of maintenance
/// and undesirable, as well as being restrictive for larger child sets.
///
/// An index would be a better approach, but this will be done later, as that is
/// purely an optimisation aspect and not a functional one, and it is better to
/// get the shape of the functionality correct, working, and testable first.
///
/// Given that we do need to obtain the children, and given also that indexes
/// are a later optimisation, the best interim approach is therefore to simply
/// store the child IDs against the struct.
///
/// This reasoning is, however, why we do not have a parent ID field. The path
/// should be sufficient to determine the parent, and so a parent ID is
/// redundant. It is also another point of maintenance and data to keep
/// consistent. For instance, moving an item in the tree should be as simple as
/// updating the path and recalculating affected [`Element`]s' hashes. If there
/// is a parent ID then that also has to be synced, and that does not give us
/// anything that we cannot already get via the path.
///
/// There are approaches that work with relational database when storing
/// hierarchies, such as BetterNestedSet to combine a NestedSet (with left and
/// right partitioning) with an AdjacencyList (parent IDs). However, operations
/// to update things like that are fast in relational databases but slow in
/// key-value stores. Therefore, this approach and other similar patterns are
/// not suitable for our use case.
