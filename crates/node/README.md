## Introduction

The Node crate is a reference implementation of Calimero protocol.

## Core components

Node struct is the main struct that holds all the components of the node. It is
responsible for handling events from network and calls from server or
interactive CLI.

    Node : +PeerId id
    Node : +NodeType typ
    Node : +Store store
    Node : +TransacitonPool tx_pool
    Node : +ContextManager ctx_manager
    Node : +NetworkClient network_client
    Node : +Sender[NodeEvents] node_events
    Node: +handle_event()
    Node: +handle_call()
```

### NodeType

`NodeType` is an enum that represents the type of the node. It can be either
`Coordinator` or `Peer`.

### Store

TODO: Write about the store and runtime compat layer, link to the store crate

### TransactionPool

`TransactionPool` is a struct that holds all the transactions that are not yet
executed. Transaction pool stores transactions in a `BTreeMap` with the key
being the hash of the transaction. `TransactionPoolEntry` is a struct that holds
the transaction, the sender of a transaction and the outcomen sender channel.

## Core flows

### Transaction handling

### Coordinator joining ceremony

Coorindator joining ceremony is the process of acquiring the coordinator node
for the context.

Setup:

- Coordinators and peers are subscribed to the dedicated coordinator ceremony
  topic.
- Context creator sends a message to the topic requesting a coordinator.
- Interested coordinators send a message to the topic replying with the intent
  to coordinate.
- Context creator selects a coordinator from the interested coordinators.
- Context creator stores `PeerId` of the selected coordinator.
- Context creator sends a message to the topic with the information about the
  selected coordinator.
- Selected coordinator joins the context topic, while other coordinators clear
  pending request.

Following diagram depicts the coordinator joining ceremony which is initiated by
a context creator peer. All the messages exchanged in diagram are GossipSub
messages going throught dedicated coordinator ceremony topic. Additionally, node
has a interval tick which is used to clean up pending requests and offers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    activate Peer
    Peer->>Peer:Generate request id
    Peer->>Coordinator:Send [Request]
    Peer->>Peer:Set pending request
    deactivate Peer

    Coordinator->>+Coordinator:Handle [Request]
    Coordinator->>Peer:Send [Offer]
    Coordinator->>-Coordinator:Set pending offer

    Peer->>+Peer:Handle [Offer]
    alt If pending request exists
        Peer->>Coordinator: Send [OfferAccepted]
        Peer->>Peer:Update context with the coordinator `PeerId`
        Peer->>Peer:Clear pending request
    else
        Peer->>-Coordinator: Send [OfferDeclined]
    end

    Coordinator->>+Coordinator:Handle [OfferAccepted]
    Coordinator->>Coordinator:Join context topic
    Coordinator->>-Coordinator:Clear pending offer

    Coordinator->>+Coordinator:Handle [OfferDeclined]
    Coordinator->>-Coordinator:Clear pending offer
```
