## Introduction

The Node crate is a reference implementation of Calimero protocol.

## Core components

Node struct is the main struct that holds all the components of the node. It is
responsible for handling events from network and calls from server or
interactive CLI.

    Node : +PeerId id
    Node : +NodeType typ
    Node : +Store store
    Node : +TransacitonPool tx_pool
    Node : +ContextManager ctx_manager
    Node : +NetworkClient network_client
    Node : +Sender[NodeEvents] node_events
    Node: +handle_event()
    Node: +handle_call()
```

### NodeType

`NodeType` is an enum that represents the type of the node. It can be either
`Coordinator` or `Peer`.

### Store

TODO: Write about the store and runtime compat layer, link to the store crate

### TransactionPool

`TransactionPool` is a struct that holds all the transactions that are not yet
executed. Transaction pool stores transactions in a `BTreeMap` with the key
being the hash of the transaction. `TransactionPoolEntry` is a struct that holds
the transaction, the sender of a transaction and the outcomen sender channel.

## Core flows

### Transaction handling

TODO: Write about the transaction handling process and draw sequence diagram

### Catchup

The catchup process is initiated by the `ClientPeer` by opening a stream to the
`ServerPeer`.

Once the connection is established, the `ClientPeer` requests the application
information from the ContextConfig contract. If the application blob id has
changed, the `ClientPeer` attempts to fetch new application blob and store it in
the store. Depending on the application source, the `ClientPeer` either fetches
the application blob from the remote BlobRegistry or requests the `ServerPeer`
to send the application blob.

After the application is updated, the `ClientPeer` requests the transactions
from the `ServerPeer`. `ServerPeer` collects executed and pending transactions
from the given hash to the latest transaction. The transactions are sent in
batches to the `ClientPeer` which applies the transactions to the store.

Following diagram depicts the catchup process. The `ClientPeer` in this scenario
is regular peer (not coordinator). The `ServerPeer` can be either regular peer
or coordinator.

```mermaid

    ClientPeer->>+ServerPeer: OpenStream
    Activate ClientPeer

    ClientPeer->>+ContextConfigContract: GetApplication(ctx_id)
    ContextConfigContract-->-ClientPeer: Application

    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: GetApplication(app_id)

    opt If ApplicationBlobId has changed

    alt ApplicationSource == HTTP
    ClientPeer->>BlobRegistry: GetApplicationBlob
    BlobRegistry-->>ClientPeer: ApplicationBlob
    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: blobs.Put(app)

    else ApplicationSource == Path
    ClientPeer->>ServerPeer: Send [ApplicationBlobRequest(app_id)]
    ServerPeer->>ClientPeer: Send [ApplicationBlobSize]
    loop
    ServerPeer->>ClientPeer: Send [ApplicationBlobChunk]
    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: blobs.Put(app)
    end

    end

    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: store.PutApplication(app)

    end

    ClientPeer->>ServerPeer: Send [TransactionsRequest(ctx_id, hash)]
    ServerPeer->>ServerPeer: CollectExecutedAndPendingTransactions(ctx_id, hash)

    loop
    ServerPeer->>-ClientPeer: Send [TransactionsBatch]
    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: ApplyBatch
    loop For Transaction in Batch
    alt Transaction.Status == Executed
    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: ExecuteTransaction

    else Transaction.Status == Pending
    ClientPeer->>ClientPeer: ExecuteTransaction
    end

    end
    end

    Deactivate ClientPeer
```
